    /// If the closure returns true, then the element is removed and yielded.
    /// If the closure returns false, the element will remain in the vector and will not be yielded
    /// by the iterator.
    ///
    /// Using this method is equivalent to the following code:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # let some_predicate = |x: &mut i32| { *x == 2 || *x == 3 || *x == 6 };
    /// # let mut vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

    ///     }
    /// }
    ///
    /// # assert_eq!(vec, vec![1, 4, 5]);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// But `drain_filter` is easier to use. `drain_filter` is also more efficient,
    /// because it can backshift the elements of the array in bulk.
    ///
    /// Note that `drain_filter` also lets you mutate every element in the filter closure,
    /// regardless of whether you choose to keep or remove it.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// Splitting an array into evens and odds, reusing the original allocation:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use drain_filter_polyfill::VecExt;
    /// let mut numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15];
